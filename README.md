# QR_Recoder
Reads and regenerates QR codes

This program is useful for creating clean backups of photographed QR codes.

Drag an image file containing a single QR code, onto the executable.
It will attempt to read the QR within the image, and then generate and save a clean output QR code as a new image.
It will work with photos where the QR code is skewed, as long as the resolution/clarity is good.

You can also drag an entire folder onto the executable, and it will attempt to process all of the images within.
